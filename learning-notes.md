Everything on fasterthanli.me, starting with https://fasterthanli.me/articles/understanding-rust-futures-by-going-way-too-deep

Rust By Example (follows the same chapter ordering to The Book) https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/

Rustlings code kata, learn by fixing tiny failing tests https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings

My video series on Rust (of course!) playlist here, watch RUST-6 first (my recommended set up) and then the rest in any order: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifaLk5v3W90&list=PLZaoyhMXgBzoM9bfb5pyUOT3zjnaDdSEP&index=6

My Discord server, especially #programming and #newbie-advice. There's a huge community of friendly folks here, answering questions on Rust all day every day. Do tag me and say hi! https://discord.gg/mCY2bBmDKZ

Have fun, and good luck!
